# TicTacGoe

This repo contains a basic implementation of TicTacToe written in Go. It can
be played on a square board of 3x3 or larger with the option to play with
either 1 or 2 players. If played 1 player, the CPU player uses the following
logic to make moves:

1) If there is a winning move, take it.
2) If you can block the player from winning, do so.
3) Otherwise, pick an open space at random.

The game is run out of a command line interface and includes ASCII art
representing  the current state of the game board.
